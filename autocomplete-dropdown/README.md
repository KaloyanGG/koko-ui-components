1. I attempted to replicate the functionality of the Autocomplete component from the Material-UI library (https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/).
2. The component includes the following features:
    - An animated ripple effect for the arrow button.
    - A smooth transition for the placeholder label.
    - A functional "search" feature with suggestions.
    - Visually appealing hover effects and dynamic borders.
    - A comprehensive solution for handling focus and blur events.
3. Please note that the "main" component is not considered part of this particular component and since I am using nested CSS, some browsers might not support it.

1. I attempted to replicate the functionality of the Angular drag-and-drop sorting UI component https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview#cdk-drag-drop-sorting.
2. The component includes the following features:
   - Working drag and drop functionality of the list elements without smooth animations.
   - Delete functionality which disappears while dragging.
   - Adding new elements to the list.
   - Clamped size of the delete button.
3. Please note that the "section" element is not considered part of this particular component as it serves as a container.
